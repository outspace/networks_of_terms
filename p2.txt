	gran im taking you to brighton for the day were going to the seaside do you remember brighton

	sarah seemed confused but at the word seaside something seemed to connect she began singing in a high shaky voice

	oh i do like to be beside the seaside

	oh i do like to be beside the sea

	i do like to stroll along the prom prom prom

	where the brass bands play: tiddely-om-pom-pom

	her voice faded away as her memory failed to find the words to complete the old music-hall song

	thats right gran the seaside thats where were going i bet you know all sorts of other songs too

	i wouldnt be surprised said sarah but im not saying i do and im not saying i dont because theyll ask me questions if i do

	oh will they said cindy

	but do i have to meet anyone special today

	no gran no-one special youre the special person for today its your birthday

	wheres my hat asked sarah all of a sudden

	what hat

	my hat i cant go to the seaside without a hat can i

	i suppose not ill look in the wardrobe said cindy

	eventually she found an old straw hat with plastic fruit on it

	here you are gran she said and put it gently on sarahs head sarah reached up immediately and changed the angle of the hat now she looked like one of those silent film actors from the 1920s

	what about that then eh she asked as she looked at herself in the mirror again she broke into song in her strange high voice

	where did you get that hat

	where did you get that tile

	isnt it a nobby one

	and just the proper style

	i should like to have one

	just the same as that

	whereer i go they shout hello

	her voice faded away again she sat silently her eyes empty it seemed as if she could only recover small pieces of memory from the web of words and pictures that crowded her mind the amazing thing for cindy was that she could still speak and use language if she could remember how to speak why couldnt she remember anything else properly it was a puzzle for cindy she hadnt realised that the new words made up by sarah didgery frooky-pooky and the rest were the first signs that even her memory for words was slowly being destroyed

	sarah had by now fallen into another light sleep when she woke a few minutes later she asked where are we i dont remember this place wheres the bungalow

	the bungalow what bungalow asked cindy

	oh you know you think im stupid but im not so stupid as you think do we have to do anything special today

	oh come on gran its your birthday were going to brighton were going to the seaside

	oh are we who told you that i dont want to do anything wrong you know theyll be asking me all those questions again and i dont know the answers sarahs eyes looked about the room suspiciously as if looking for them

	its your birthday gran lets have a good time ok

	is my mother coming too what about my dad sarah looked upset and confused again

	come on gran lets get you dressed its a lovely day look at the sunshine its a lovely may morning lets get on the road

	

	jan helped cindy put sarah into the car by eleven oclock cindy had arrived in brighton

	the sun was shining brightly and the sea looked inviting she parked the car not far-from the seafront and took the wheelchair out of the car boot somehow she managed to half-lift half-push sarah into it

	where are we asked sarah nervously

	this is brighton gran were at the seaside come on lets go and she began to push the wheelchair quickly down towards the pier

	shall we go on the pier gran asked cindy

	sarahs eyes suddenly brightened

	its the seaside its the seaside she kept repeating

	there were already crowds of people walking along the seafront and sitting on the stony beach english people are odd thought cindy the minute the sun comes out they take off their shirts and show their pale skin even if the temperature is well below fifteen degrees celsius and they become more open and start to talk more as cindy pushed the wheelchair through the crowds people began to talk to sarah

	hello dear going for a ride

	hello sweetheart where did you get that hat

	lovely day isnt it having a nice time are you

	sarah was a bit surprised by all the attention she looked around her turning her head to the left and right

	where are we going wheres my mum she asked cindy nervously

	its ok gran were going to the pier

	brighton pier sticks out into the sea like a bridge with no land at one end its like a big funfair with small stalls selling ice cream sticks of pink brighton rock souvenirs balloons and all sorts of toys for children of all ages and you can try your luck at the shooting gallery and win perhaps a large pink fluffy bear or you can ask the fortune teller to tell you your future or play on the pinball and gambling machines

	cindy pushed the wheelchair to the end of the pier where they had a good view of the sea a few men were fishing the sun was shining on the sea so brightly that it hurt cindys eyes she put on her sunglasses it was beginning to get quite hot

	shall i get you an ice cream gran

	ice cream sarah concentrated hard trying to decide whether these words had anything to do with something she could remember then she suddenly started to shout ice cream you scream ice cream nice ice cream oh yes please

	ok ill go and get you one i wont be a minute just wait here ill be straight back

	when cindy returned a few minutes later she found sarah surrounded by a group of teenage girls

	hi she said whats going on

	i dunno said one of the girls we was walking by and she called out to us wheres my mum she kept saying is she all right

	dont worry said cindy she gets a bit confused sometimes

	sarah who had been staring out to sea grabbed the ice cream from cindy and started to lick it greedily making loud noises with her tongue and lips

	she seems to be enjoying it said another girl

	its her birthday today said cindy shes eighty

	wow said the first girl eighty thats seriously old

	come on said the second girl lets sing happy birthday whats her name

	sarah said cindy

	so the group of girls began to sing

	happy birthday to you

	happy birthday to you

	happy birthday dear sarah

	happy birthday to you

	as they sang more people gathered round and some of them joined in the singing they sang the song through again then they went on with

	for shes a jolly good fellow

	for shes a jolly good fellow

	for shes a jolly good fellow

	and so say all of us

	by now a large crowd had gathered sarah still wearing her old straw hat decorated with the plastic fruit sat in her wheelchair like a queen on a throne the ice cream was melting in the hot sun she had ice cream all round her mouth and it was running down her hand and on to her dress

	careful gran watch out for the ice cream here let me clean it up said cindy trying to clean up the mess with some tissues

	dont take my ice cream shouted sarah i know your tricks

	the crowd started laughing good-humouredly sarah frowned at them

	dont you laugh at me she said ill teach you a lesson you wont forget in a hurry

	then her mood changed again thank you all so much for coming she said in her best voice its very good of you id like to sing you a song but i want you all to join in now lets start ready and she began to sing all things bright and beautiful

	a few of the older people in the crowd began to sing with her until almost everyone was taking part even the ones who didnt know the words

	now lets have another song said sarah when she came to the end and she started again in her crazy high voice oh i do like to be beside the seaside-

	but this time there was no need for her to tell the crowd to join in; they began singing along with her straight away the concert went on for nearly half an hour and they sang lots of old favourite songs sometimes sarah forgot the words or got them all mixed up sometimes she sang wildly out of tune but nobody seemed to mind they were all enjoying themselves

	then sarah suddenly clapped her hands im very sorry im afraid i have to leave you now i have to meet someone in town it was so kind of you all to come thank you all so much

	the crowd parted to let her wheelchair through as cindy pushed her back towards the seafront sarah waved her hand at them just like a queen a man in the crowd called out shes a real character three cheers for sarah hip-hip hooray hip-hip hooray hip-hip hooray

	so sarah and cindy left the pier in right royal style



	chapter fourteen

	get out of my life

	meanwhile back in lewisham kate had just arrived for lunch with jan at sarahs house

	wheres mother kate asked i brought her these flowers and some belgian chocolates and a whole lot of soaps and shampoos

	shes out for the day cindys taken her out theyve gone to brighton itll do them both good said jan

	you mean shes not here thats a bit much said kate she was obviously angry that her mother wasnt there to see her after all she said i am her daughter and its her eightieth birthday

	i know said jan its a pity you didnt remember that before

	but you knew i was coming accused kate

	yes i did but i didnt see why mother shouldnt get a treat on her birthday anyway you came to talk to me about your idea not to see her

	the conversation throughout lunch was difficult the sisters tried desperately to find something to say to each other that wouldnt start another argument over coffee jan finally asked the question they both knew had to be answered

	so whats this idea of yours about dealing with mother and her condition

	kate sighed i told you its a bit complicated but ill try to make it as simple as i can

	ok go ahead

	well you dont have the money to pay for care for mother

	no you know perfectly well that i dont said jan impatiently

	yes but what about her

	what do you mean she only has her pension and the money dad invested for her i checked up what it costs and she certainly doesnt have enough to pay for the kind of special care she needs

	thats true said kate but she owns the house its a big house this area isnt particularly fashionable but the house is still pretty valuable house prices are rising again and anywhere in london is always good

	surely youre not suggesting she should sell the house said jan starting to feel her anger rising inside her

	no no no of course not theres no need to sell it i think theres a much better way for all of us jan let me try to explain what a lot of old people do these days is this: they make an agreement with someone this someone agrees to pay them a regular amount of money every month until they die but when they die the house becomes the property of the person who has been paying the money every month its a risk for the person who agrees to pay out the money if the old person lives for another twenty years its a very bad investment they could end up losing a lot of money the main thing for the older person is that they have some degree of comfort for the rest of their life i didnt think it was such a good idea when hugh mentioned it first but when i thought about it carefully i could see the advantages for mother

	and who do you think would make an agreement like that with mother

	well ive discussed it with hugh and weve agreed that we could pay mother $1500 a month i know that wouldnt cover everything but it would certainly help its at least something we could do to make her life more comfortable after seeing how she was when she came to stay i can see how she cant go on like this and neither can you

	are you serious said jan her voice becoming excited and emotional do you mean to say that you and your millionaire husband are planning to treat mother like an investment on the stock exchange or a bet on the horses youre betting her life against your money hoping shell die sooner rather than later you make me sick

	but jan listen it isnt like that just think mother is eighty shes weak and losing her memory but theres nothing seriously wrong with her with luck she could live till shes a hundred just think what that would mean - we could pay her more than $300000 so we wouldnt exactly be making a fortune out of it we just thought it would be a good solution to the situation nothing more than that we certainly dont think of it as a gamble on mothers life im not that heartless you know

	but you are how can you be so calculating so cold jan said sharply were talking about your mother not about a property investment its not about profit and loss its about a human being i think youve lost all your human feelings youre like a machine programmed to make money cant you see how disgusting it is whats wrong with you if you can afford to pay her $1500 a month then just pay it dont expect to make a profit out of it

	but jan were just trying to be helpful its a very reasonable offer everyone does well out of it it gets cindy away from having to act as a nurse for her grandmother it allows you to get on with your new job it makes sure mother is properly looked after and mother doesnt lose anything she would go on living in her house till she dies ok we get the house at the end of it but we will have paid fork

	kate i was going to make you coffee but ive changed my mind i think youd better go i really think youd better leave before i throw you out youre disgusting calculating selfish i dont know what else to say get out and take your flowers and your chocolates and your other rubbish with you dont bother to contact us again its over as far as im concerned i dont have a sister anymore

	she took kate to the front door pushed her out and threw the flowers and the rest of the presents out after her then she banged the door shut and burst into tears



	chapter fifteen

	italian birthday lunch

	back in brighton cindy had found a cheerful-looking italian restaurant for lunch there were a few tables with big umbrellas outside on the pavement she managed to push sarahs wheelchair up to one of these tables

	hello signorina said the young italian waiter he was very handsome cindy thought buon giorno signora he said to sarah you having a nice day

	sarah didnt even look at him she was staring across the road at the sea but her eyes were empty

	is it your mamma he asked cindy

	oh no shes my grandmother said cindy

	ah la normal lovely hat signora i get you the menu

	yes please said cindy but im not sure what shell eat shes a bit difficult but today is her birthday so

	is her birthday oh lovely how old

	shes eighty today

	mamma mia ottantanni wait i go tell my papa hell come to see you and he rushed inside and came back with a smiling middle-aged man with a round belly covered by a large white apron

	buon giorno signore he said and bowed his head to cindy and sarah he turned to sarah is your happy birthday happy birthday i make you something special ok you leave it to me leave it to paolo first i bring you some water and some wine we make the happy birthday brindisi how you say toast ok

	wheres my tea i want a cup of tea demanded sarah

	is all right no problem i make you a cup of tea

	a few minutes later the son whose name was giovanni brought them some mineral water a bottle of chianti wine and a cup of tea he then produced a plate of antipasti: parma ham olives cheese sausage and tomatoes

	here gran try some of this ham said cindy

	is it cooked asked sarah suspiciously

	its special gran from italy

	i dont want any of that foreign stuff said sarah i want some fish and chips

	gran this is an italian restaurant they make lovely food and the owner is very nice come on just try a little

	cindy served herself with a large helping - she felt really hungry after their morning on the pier - and began to eat

	its delicious she said to giovanni when he came back but my gran is terribly difficult about her food

	its ok you enjoy it ok

	just then his father came back with four wine glasses and poured the wine

	ok everybody whats your nonnas name

	sarah

	lovely ok sarah lets drink to your happy birthday just a little drink not much ok he smiled sweedy at sarah who was delighted by all this special attention she picked up her wine glass carefully as if she was afraid to drop it

	ok everybody heres to lovely signora sarah for her eighty birthday salute cheers

	they all drank even sarah sipped a little of the wine

	this isnt bad she said unexpectedly and she emptied the whole glass in one go can i have some more

	with her glass refilled sarah said loudly i dont think ill have my tea after all you can take it away if you like and excuse me but have you seen my mum and dad anywhere around i heard they were coming today but i havent seen them so far

	cindy made a sign to the men not to take any notice of this strange question

	its ok gran i think theyve gone somewhere else today lets have some food

	excuse me young man said sarah to paolo the owner can i have some fish and chips

	im sorry signora sarah but we dont do the fish and chips its not italian you know

	but i want fish and chips demanded sarah

	paolo and giovanni had a whispered conversation in italian then paolo said ok is your birthday this time i make you the fish and chips special one ok italian style

	sarah didnt seem to have heard him she was staring at the sea again lost in a world of her own

	they were at the restaurant for nearly two hours sarah got her fish and chips italian style cindy had some tasty ravioli and a delicious veal dish cooked with herbs called saltimbocca alia romana they finished their lunch with a big chocolate cake paolo had written on it in cream hapy birtday sara when cindy asked for the bill paolo refused to let them pay for the wine fish and chips or cake

	is for happy birthday he said with a big smile all cindy could do was to thank him

	by the time they left sarah was looking tired but happy this was hardly surprising as shed managed to drink four glasses of wine giovanni and cindy had given each other their telephone numbers and agreed to meet again sometime on their way back to the car sarah fell asleep in the wheelchair it was difficult for cindy to get her into the car as they set off on the return journey to london sarah woke up again she seemed upset about something

	whats the matter gran asked cindy do you want me to stop

	wheres my mum why didnt she come have they taken her away you dont know anything about them did you see them its all plunky boodle doodle do i cant answer all the plimsy-wimsy questions why do they keep asking me all those questions i dont know the answers-

	after a while she stopped talking to herself and fell asleep again

	getting back to lewisham took a long time all roads were full of cars driving back into london after a day at the seaside and the roads in south london were even worse with traffic stopping and starting it was seven oclock by the time cindy parked the car outside sarahs house

	jan came out to help cindy get sarah into the house they took her upstairs straight away and put her to bed

	have you had a good day mum asked jan

	sarah seemed confused then her eyes brightened and she said in her best voice ive had a lovely day then she began to sing again i do like to be beside the seaside her voice got fainter and fainter till it stopped her eyes closed and she fell asleep with a smile on her lips



	chapter sixteen

	time to face facts

	when kate arrived home from jans hugh was already back from his golf there was dirt on his golf shoes so perhaps he really had been playing golf this time

	hello darling he said in a tired voice kate noticed that he had an empty whisky glass on the small table next to him he saw the direction of her look

	do you think you could pour me another one he said opening the business pages of the sunday newspaper

	i think you can get it yourself if you really want to poison yourself to death kate said ive been driving and im tired i need a shower ill tell you about what happened when i come down

	all right all right said hugh and got up slowly from his armchair as she went upstairs

	when kate came down again hugh was still reading his newspaper and sipping his whisky she wondered how many glasses he had had so far

	so how was your dear older sister jan today i hope she was in a better mood than last time

	she looked ok but she made me really angry mother wasnt there and it was her eightieth birthday id bought her flowers and chocolates and everything can you believe it jan had let cindy take her to brighton of all places i was furious id gone all that way to see her and she wasnt there

	really im sure jan only did that to upset you but your mothers birthday wasnt your main reason for going was it so what did she say about our offer for the house hugh asked

	she said she couldnt believe what i was telling her she said it was disgusting to gamble on how long mother would live she said we werent human beings any more just machines for making money she said a lot of things like that then she threw me out of the house so the answers no and now i think about it im not surprised jans always been like that - hot-tempered emotional never logical she can never think straight

	oh well we tried anyway said hugh though there was disappointment in his voice it seemed he had really been hoping that jan would accept their offer never mind at least we dont have to do anything more now that shes refused our help we dont need to worry about jan and your mother now its a pity about the house though - that was a really good opportunity

	he picked up his newspaper again but this time kate knew the moment was right for them to talk she couldnt delay it any longer there had been too many suspicious things going on it was time to clear the air once and for all

	listen hugh she said in a tight nervous voice she really wasnt sure how to start this conversation i think its really time for us to have a proper talk

	what do you mean talk about what he said opening the newspaper

	for gods sake will you put down your newspaper and listen to me for a change im trying to talk to you

	hugh put down his newspaper and took a sip of whisky

	ok darling go ahead he said in a cheerful voice though his face didnt look cheerful at all

	and can you stop drinking just for five minutes this isnt a joke im serious we have to talk

	fine but what about exactly asked hugh looking bored

	about us i want to talk about us about our marriage hugh

	what do you mean whats wrong with our marriage asked hugh innocently kate thought to herself how men always tried to avoid unpleasant things but she went on

	whats right with it thats what you need to ask we hardly ever see each other these days youre always going off here or there half the time i dont even know where you are and when we are in the house together you have your nose stuck in the newspaper or in a glass of whisky its months since we really shared a meal together or talked about anything important

	oh come on darling its not as bad as that

	oh yes it is in fact its worse we never make love any more its over a year now youre always too tired but i wonder if thats the real reason anyway

	what are you suggesting

	im suggesting that you have someone else

	oh come on how can you think such a thing when do i have time for that sort of thing you know im working flat out on my investment fund

	hugh please dont take me for a fool ive known you for over twenty-five years now and i can read you like a book first of all what about all those times you told me you were playing golf i dont know where you were but you certainly werent at the golf club and what about the nights that you didnt come home and what about all those missed calls from melpa on your mobile phone i wonder what dear melpa needed to talk to you about so urgently

	hughs mouth fell open he hadnt been expecting this

	so said kate in an ice-cold voice whats going on i want to know how serious is it do you love her

	hugh looked down and didnt answer his face had gone bright red

	come on i want to know is it melpa do you love her

	instead of answering hugh took a large drink of his whisky and began walking nervously up and down

	look kate he said at last i dont know how to begin it started a few months ago i ran into melpa in london one day and we went for lunch and somehow one thing led to another till neither of us could do anything about it its so easy to start these things but once youre past a certain point its impossible to stop yes i do love her im sorry kate god knows what were all going to do you know perfectly well what will happen if her husband finds out hell do his best to ruin me

	right hugh thanks for being honest with me - at last if thats how things are i want you to sleep in jeremys room tonight the bed is already made up i dont want to see you in the morning and i suggest you move into the flat in london until weve sorted out the divorce

	divorce said hugh who said anything about a divorce

	i did said kate in her cold unfeeling voice and i meant it surely you dont think im going to just sit there like an idiot while you do whatever you want to oh no this marriage is over it cant go on then youll be free to marry your greek beauty if she still wants you by then goodnight



	chapter seventeen

	there is a time

	next morning when cindy took sarah her tea she didnt answer her when she said cheerfully good morning gran its another lovely day

	she pulled the curtains back and let in the bright may sunshine

	come on gran dont let your tea get cold she said as she went back downstairs to prepare sarahs breakfast

	half an hour later she came back carrying the tray she noticed that sarah hadnt touched her tea

	come on gran youve let your tea get cold let me get you a fresh cup she said but when she looked down at sarah she realised that her grandmother would never drink a cup of tea again she had stopped breathing sarah was dead there was a smile on her lips and she looked peaceful as if she had died in a sleep full of pleasant dreams

	cindy sat down on the bed her head in her hands crying helplessly she realised just how much shed grown to love this crazy but lovely old lady all their times together came back to her: the funny words sarah had made up her changes of mood her forgetfulness her old songs and above all the birthday trip to brighton

	cindy dried her eyes with a handkerchief and sat up she knew she had to do something quickly the first thing was to tell her mother she called jans office number

	mum im sorry but i have some bad news for you gran died in her sleep last night i thought she was asleep when i took her tea but when i came back with her breakfast i saw cindys voice broke as she started to cry again oh mum why did she have to die like this we didnt even have the chance to say goodbye to her properly-

	there was a pause before jan spoke

	its a shock for us both i know said jan but just think: maybe this was the best way for her to die she had a lovely day out on her birthday - thanks to you and it seems she died in her sleep without fear and without pain thank goodness for that but oh my god cindy heard her mother suddenly break down in tears she soon recovered

	listen cindy call the doctor immediately then just wait for me ill tell my boss dave what has happened and ill be back with you in about an hour dont try to do anything else till i get there right

	ok mum i think i need a strong cup of coffee to keep me going ill wait for you

	

	cindy was a bit surprised to see her mother arrive outside the house in a car

	dave was so sweet said jan as she came in he gave me a lift home he was very understanding

	that was really good of him said cindy what shall we do first

	i want to go up and sit with mother for a few minutes before we do anything please wait down here i just want to be alone with her

	ok mum ill make you a cup of nice strong coffee while im waiting

	when jan came down again she looked pale and upset but she smiled bravely she looks so peaceful she said its almost as if shes just sleeping i half-expected her to sit up and ask one of her crazy questions but im glad she went like that without suffering

	yes im glad too in a way but i wish i could have told her how much i loved her before she died

	its ok cindy im sure she knew that you had some wonderful times together and she went out on a high im sure she knew right now wheres that coffee we need to make a list of all the things to do

	they sat together at the kitchen table with their coffee and a notepad and started the long list of people to contact death is simple for the person who dies once its over they have nothing left to do but for their family and loved ones there are hundreds of things to be done the doctor has to come to write out the death certificate the undertaker has to come to make the arrangements for the funeral and of course all the family members and friends have to be told then there has to be a small party after the funeral the solicitor has to be called to arrange for the reading of the will and later someone would have to deal with whatever sarah had left - the house her belongings the money in the bank and so on

	the list seemed to be endless yet these things had to be done it seems unfortunate and unfair that just when people should be left to grieve over the death of someone close to them they have to get involved in all these practical things instead

	as soon as theyd completed the list jan started to make the phone calls it was early evening before she had finished the funeral was arranged for the following friday she had just put the phone down after the last call when it rang

	she answered it hello jan here whos speaking please

	hello can i please speak to cindy the voice sounded foreign

	just a minute ill call her who shall i say it is

	its giovanni from brighton

	jan called cindy who took the phone into the lounge and spoke for a long time when she came back she was crying again

	oh mum sometimes people are so kind that was giovanni from the italian restaurant where i took gran for her birthday i told you about him and his dad he called to ask me out next week but as soon as i told him about gran he got very emotional he says hell tell his father he wants to know if they can come to the funeral too he says they liked sarah so much even though they only met her once he says his father will call us again later

	thats really sweet of them said jan i cant see why they shouldnt come there wont be that many people most of sarahs friends are dead too and the family isnt very big either oh my god - family -i forgot to call kate

	do you think she might be interested said cindy with a bitter smile

	i must tell her of course i must i know shes been really awful about mother but she is her daughter she has to be told ill keep it short though

	she picked up the phone again and dialed kates number

	hello kate its me jan im calling you to let you know that mother died in her sleep last night the funeral will be next friday well be sending out cards tomorrow as soon as i can get some made i hope you can all come do you think hugh and caroline and jeremy will be able to make it

	anyway ill send cards to you all i have to run now theres lots to do as you can imagine

	oh my god thats a shock i dont know what to say i

	no need to say anything to me you know what i think of you that hasnt changed just let me know whos coming thats all and dont bother to send flowers; send some money to the alzheimers charity instead

	i hope jeremy will be able to come carolines in brussels i dont know if she can get away and hugh hugh will definitely not be coming were living separately now - you might as well know that

	i see serves you both right i expect ok then thats it goodnight and jan put down the phone

	later that evening after the doctor had been and signed the death certificate (death from natural causes) and the undertaker had been in to take the body away and lay it out in his memorial chapel jan and cindy sat together and shared a bottle of good wine and some cheese they were both exhausted - too tired to prepare a proper supper they agreed that cindy should go back to their house and jan would sleep there at her mothers so the long day ended at last

	the funeral took place the following friday as arranged it was a rainy afternoon and there were only a few people there: jan and cindy of course jans boss dave (he really did seem to like jan) a couple of cindys friends kate and her son jeremy corrie (she had insisted on coming when kate told her the news) a few neighbours and giovanni and paolo from brighton jan and kate didnt speak to each other

	sarah had always said she didnt want to be buried in the earth; she wanted to be cremated and she had told jan that she wanted her ashes to be scattered in the garden of her house where she had spent so many happy years before her husband died the crematorium felt a bit like a church but there was no religious ceremony sarah hadnt been a believer in any religion jan and cindy read some short poems and jan said a few words about her mother then as the recorded music played - vaughan williams the lark ascending - the coffin rolled smoothly towards the entrance of the oven disappeared inside and was swallowed by flames outside jan and cindy and kate stood and shook hands with the people who had come behind them smoke rose from a tall chimney

	please come back to our house for some refreshments said jan most people started to leave the crematorium but kate and jeremy waited for a moment

	i think wed better go said kate jeremy has to get back to cambridge and i should be getting home too

	ok then said jan i wasnt really expecting you to stay anyway ill let you know when the solicitor calls us for the reading of the will and she turned and walked away leaving them standing in the rain

	back at the house the guests were soon in conversation most of it was about sarah and how everyone had liked her even if she had become so strange in her old age they didnt stay too long and soon jan and cindy were left to clear up the plates and glasses

	giovanni seems like a nice young man said jan

	yes i like him a lot said cindy hes asked me out when all this is over

	what did you say said jan

	why yes of course im not that stupid mum

	of course youre not his dad was very lively too a very warm personality such a cheerful man

	and what about dave he seemed very worried about you is anything going on between you two

	come on cindy im fifty-four years old and well past my best why should he be interested in me

	lets see about that said cindy with a smile

	

	the following week jan and kate met in the solicitors office the solicitor who had looked after the familys legal affairs for many years knew them both of course the will was in one of those long legal envelopes which he opened with a special silver paper knife the will wasnt a long document it must have been arranged by their father before he died sarah wouldnt have been able to do it herself although she had signed it the solicitor read it out aloud kate got the house in lewisham with all its contents jan got what was left of sarahs savings - about $50000 as usual kate was the favourite daughter and jan got the leftovers jan and kate signed the documents and left without speaking to each other



	chapter eighteen

	things fall apart things come together

	only a few weeks after kate and hugh separated things started to go badly wrong for hugh he had moved into their small flat in london and kate hadnt spoken to him since their final argument and to make it worse jeremy and caroline had turned their backs on him too

	kate simply tried to get on with her life while the divorce was going through then one evening hugh called her his voice sounded strange as if hed been drinking and kate wondered how much hed had this time

	listen kate he said im in deep trouble everything has fallen apart clerides found out about melpa and me and took all his money out of the fund then he persuaded mazumdar to do the same when manningham found out he took his money out too the whole fund has collapsed and now the others are coming after me for the money they lent me i have nothing left even the house i had to offer it as security and now theyll take it away from us

	you what shouted kate you gambled with our house without telling me and now youve lost it what am i supposed to do now where am i supposed to live

	its all my fault i know said hugh i was a fool to borrow so much i thought it was safe but now-

	now youre in a hole said kate in a hard voice and you dont know how to climb out of it so why come to me what do you expect me to do youve ruined my life too especially if they take the house my god i wish id never met you

	i cant think straight said hugh in his thick drunken voice and they may call in the police too there were some things i did-

	look hugh i have enough to do to save what i can of my own stuff - i cant get involved with yours too you made your choice now you can live with it dont bother me again understand and she put down the phone

	

	kate was a quick-thinking realistic woman she realised that there was no hope of saving the house so she had all the contents packed and put into store then she and corrie moved into her mothers old house in lewisham

	jan only found out about this when they met in the local supermarket by chance one friday evening

	what are you doing here jan asked completely surprised by this unexpected meeting

	something happened i needed to move out of the house in marlow so ive moved into mothers place strange isnt it i never expected to find myself living here again

	but for once jan couldnt find any words she wanted to complain that kate couldnt just move in like that but of course she could the house was hers it wasnt jans business any more

	well i wouldnt have chosen to move back here but i had no choice hughs investment fund has collapsed and hes being chased by everyone who lent him money at least i have somewhere to live and actually the old house is really quite comfortable and theres plenty of space it needs to be repainted and modernised but its got lots of possibilities and the garden is still lovely

	yes the garden said jan i was going to contact you about that ive still got mothers ashes at home we need to arrange to scatter them in the garden thats what she wanted

	so when do you want to do that

	well i suppose now that youre there it will have to be at a time that suits you said jan

	well how about next weekend - sunday afternoon is that ok

	 ill need to invite a few people too: cindy and giovanni - her new boyfriend - my boss dave corrie if shes with you what about your kids

	i dont think so jan but ill be there of course do you want corrie to prepare something to eat or anything

	that would be nice just some snacks and drinks will be enough dont go to too much trouble

	ok lets say four oclock on sunday afternoon then

	right ill tell the others and ill bring mothers ashes with me

	

	it was a perfect june day when they all gathered in the garden of sarahs house there was a light breeze jan took the heavy pot containing sarahs ashes and threw a handful in the air the breeze caught them and blew the white cloud across the grass and the flowers she handed the pot to kate who did the same then it was cindys turn they took turns until the pot was empty sarah had gone back to her garden just as she had wanted no-one spoke for a while everyone was remembering sarah in their thoughts



	chapter nineteen

	forgive and forget

	six months after sarahs death things were finally settling down for cindy and for jan

	jan gave cindy some of the money from her mothers will cindy decided to use it to help pay for her training as a chiropodist so far she was doing well in her course and was expecting to qualify in about two years time after that she was hoping to open her own business she had got rid of her green hair and removed most (but not quite all) of the rings in various parts of her body after all the wasted years her life had suddenly improved shed found something she really liked doing shed also found someone to spend her free time with after the funeral shed started seeing a lot of giovanni they were planning to go on holiday to italy together later in the year

	after years of dull living with no hope of anything better jan had started living life fully again things were going well at work she was promoted and got a pay rise the money she got from sarahs will wasnt that much after shed given some to cindy but it was enough to give her some security at last she could afford to go out to eat in her favourite thai restaurants again and she could go to the cinema whenever she wanted she redecorated her house too and bought herself a small second-hand car best of all she could make new friends again and she began to see dave regularly

	as time passed jan began to feel that she could forgive what kate had done though she would never forget it she thought life was too short to go on hating someone forever and now that kate herself had suffered so much from her break-up with hugh and losing her home jan felt it was time to heal the wounds between them after the sunday when they scattered sarahs ashes they saw each other occasionally for coffee or lunch

	kate had changed a lot too she was more relaxed and less selfish so one sunday lunchtime they found themselves sitting again in jans small kitchen eating a roast chicken and drinking red wine (a better bottle than the last time)

	soon it would be christmas again and cindy had gone off to italy with giovanni they would be back for new year one evening cindy called jan from italy her voice sounded very excited

	mum can you guess giovannis asked me to marry him

	i cant say im surprised jan said laughing and what did you say

	i said yes of course hes lovely and i feel its the real thing this time

	well i hope youll be very happy together have you fixed a date yet

	no not yet he needs to talk to his dad first

	maybe the spring would be a good time or do you want to wait till after you finish your training

	i dont know theres so much to think about what about your love life mum has dave asked you yet

	well he took me out to dinner the other evening and yes he did ask me to marry him

	and what did you say mum

	mum try not to be silly this is the best thing thats happened to you in years promise me youll call him up as soon as i put the phone down go on promise

	there was a short pause then jan said with laughter in her voice ok cindy you win i promise
