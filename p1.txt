	chapter one

	remembering and forgetting

	jan picked up the telephone and called her sisters number but there was only an answerphone message: im sorry theres no-one available to take your call please leave a message after the beep

	jan tried to make her message as calm as possible

	hello kate this is jan im sorry but youll have to come down to mothers weve got to talk i cant go on like this its becoming impossible i know youre always busy but youll have to come i cant manage with mother any more please call me back at mothers house as soon as you can

	her mothers voice called weakly from the next room

	who was that dear

	no-one important dont worry mum

	well if i dont worry whos going to worry someone has to do the worrying

	its ok mum really

	oh good did you have a nice time then

	sorry

	didnt you go on holiday somewhere

	not me mum that was mrs jenkins from next door

	oh who are you then

	mum im jan im your daughter surely you can recognise me

	oh yes thats right the trouble is theres too much to remember i cant remember everything you know

	i know that mum i know

	jan sighed it was late on sunday afternoon the room was already getting dark on the table there was a bowl of rotting fruit - the bananas were black the oranges brown on the shelf above stood her parents wedding photograph in a silver frame it was yellow with age next to it stood a framed photo of her sister kate getting her degree from oxford university then there were pictures of jans daughter cindy and kates children jeremy and caroline when they were all on holiday together in spain in happier times there was a picture of kate and her husband and children by the river in the garden of their beautiful house in marlow there were pictures of herself and kate as children she picked up a picture of her father he was carrying kate on his shoulders he looked so strong so confident so full of life

	there were no photos of jan with her father that was typical he had always loved kate more she had been his favourite in everything jan remembered how hed always treated her so badly and kate so well when jan left school shed had to go out to work not go to university like kate but kate had had the best of everything jan had always felt hurt by it why were families like this she wondered anyway now her father had been dead for nearly four years

	as she put the photograph back jan noticed the thick dust on the shelf she sighed again

	outside the window a cold wind was blowing the petals off the spring flowers it began to rain

	is my father still alive came the tired voice from the armchair

	no mum he died twenty years ago

	oh did he what about my mum did she die too

	yes mum she died ten years ago dont you remember

	are you sure i thought she came round for a cup of tea last week

	no mum that was old mrs jenkins who lives next door

	oh was it her voice died away as she slowly thought about this piece of confusing information

	she was silent for a while her hands lay still in her lap except when she occasionally moved the newspaper she was holding her eyelids were heavy her eyes almost closed she began to breathe more loudly a low bubbling sound coming from her throat she was dribbling from the corner of her mouth and down her chin like a baby jan tiptoed to the kitchen and put the kettle on for a cup of tea when she returned her mother was still fast asleep her mouth loosely open her head had fallen to one side

	suddenly she woke up her eyes were wide open but they were empty they seemed to see nothing then they slowly focused again

	oh hello she said brightly nice of you to visit me have you been here long

	ive been here since yesterday mum dont you remember

	oh have you yes perhaps you have but you cant expect me to remember every little thing you know

	she picked up the newspaper from her lap and looked at it but without reading it

	anyway wheres my tea i cant do without my tea

	ive already put the kettle on mum it wont be long

	i should hope not i cant wait around forever can i ive got work to do

	i know mum i know

	jan went to the kitchen and prepared a tray with cups milk and sugar then she made the tea strong and dark the way her mother liked it suddenly her eyes filled with tears

	she swore softly under her breath why do you have to hang on to life like this its over for you why cant you just die like other people god forgive me but why dont you just let go and die i cant bear to see you suffering like this anymore

	she dried her eyes took a deep breath and carried the tray in to her mother

	

	it was past eleven oclock that night when the phone rang jan had already fed and bathed her mother and put her to bed she felt tired so tired she picked up the phone

	hello

	hello jan its kate i got your message whats the problem

	jan took the phone into the kitchen and closed the door

	the problem what do you think the problem is its our mother of course

	why has something happened

	something is happening all the time her mind is falling to pieces bits of her memory are falling into a big black hole

	but surely its not that bad is it i mean she seemed pretty lively to me when i came down to see her last month

	yes it is that bad in fact it gets worse every week every day even ive had to see the doctor about her again and he says she shouldnt be on her own she cant look after herself he says she needs twenty-four-hour care its all happening so fast ah its all very well for you you come down here once a month if that spend a few hours with her and then rush off home again you should try living round the corner from her like me

	surely youre not suggesting that i should drop everything in marlow and move down to lewisham are you

	oh no i wouldnt dream of it your life has to run like clockwork doesnt it nothing must upset your routines - your law cases and your children and your holidays and your husband and your maid - it all has to be organised doesnt it you have so much to do

	dont be so unfair jan i made my choices and you made yours its not my fault that youre stuck in lewisham you should have moved away when you had the chance when dad died maybe it would have saved your marriage too

	leave my marriage out of this mind your own business my husband was a stupid idiot and he would have been a stupid idiot wherever we were

	ok ok calm down i didnt mean to hurt you

	all right sorry im tired ive been staying here with mother all weekend and im going to stay tonight as well

	well im tired too we went mountain climbing in wales over the weekend and the drive back here was terrible you know what the motorway traffic is like on a sunday it took us absolutely hours to get back home

	look kate weve got to meet i cant talk to you properly over the phone can you get down here any day this week

	not during the week jan you know that i have this big case coming up and i may have to fly over to paris to see some clients

	what about next weekend

	well i was planning to go up to cambridge to see jeremy for the weekend but i suppose i could just go for the day on saturday

	good can you come straight here from cambridge on saturday evening and stay the night

	sorry jan i dont think so it would be too much of a rush and weve got a dinner party with some of hughs business partners on sunday evening its important i have to be there so ill come down in time for lunch at your place on sunday and drive back here in the evening

	what about hugh will he come with you

	erm there was a long pause i doubt it you know how he loves his golf

	all right then lets leave it like that - youll come down next sunday but please come prepared to listen to me we cant just go on arguing all the time

	quite all right big sister sleep well

	you too goodnight

	jan went back into the lounge she needed a drink she searched through her mothers drinks cupboard and found a half-empty bottle of napoleon brandy in fact it looked as if it had been there since the time of napoleon she poured herself a glass drank it down and went up to bed



	chapter two

	a perfect couple

	kate put down the telephone in her study and went back to join her husband hugh in the lounge like the rest of their house it had expensive modern furniture with glass and shiny metal tables leather sofas and armchairs and a thick cream-coloured carpet

	hugh was sitting in one of the armchairs his feet up on a low table reading the business and finance pages of the sunday newspaper and sipping a large glass of whisky as she looked down at him kate noticed not for the first time that he was losing his hair and getting rather too fat around the middle sometimes she wondered why she had married him he put the newspaper down

	so what was that all about he asked

	it was jan

	i know it was jan you told me shed left a message what did she want this time

	its about mother

	oh no not again surely does she really expect you to call on a sunday evening just to talk about your mother his voice sounded unpleasant impatient

	she says mother is getting worse she says that she forgets things and cant look after herself anymore

	well shes old isnt she thats the way old people are they do forget things and get mixed up what does she expect whats it got to do with us anyway

	well she is my mother you know and jan says that she cant manage any longer she wants me to go down there and discuss it

	i dont see what there is to discuss said hugh unhelpfully thank goodness my parents are both dead at least they cant cause any trouble like that

	anyway i told her id go down to lewisham next sunday

	you told her what have you forgotten we have a dinner on sunday evening i told you it was important im trying to get clerides and mazumdar to sign up to my new investment fund god cant you remember anything

	i didnt forget im not like my mother not yet anyway ill go down there for lunch and ill be back late afternoon in plenty of time for your dinner dont be so bad-tempered its not easy for me you know

	its not easy for any of us said hugh and picked up his newspaper again

	kate went back to her study switched on the desk light and began to read the papers for her court case the next morning it was a complicated case involving a disagreement between members of a family about who should own the parents house and business property she sighed she felt tired - exhausted by the mountain climbing in wales and the long drive back to marlow - and now she couldnt stop herself thinking about jan and the problems with her mother why wasnt life simpler she thought she had a successful career as a lawyer hugh was doing well again in his investment business the children were grown up - well almost she and hugh had plenty of money; it should have been the time for them to relax and enjoy it but instead she felt discontented and unhappy why

	something was wrong but she couldnt say what it was - just a feeling that things should be different

	it was past two oclock in the morning by the time they both went upstairs as they were getting ready for bed kate looked at hugh again and wondered if he was the same person she had married all those years ago he got into bed and turned off the light

	good night darling he said and turned his back to her he was soon fast asleep kate lay awake for a long time thinking how easy it was to say darling and wondering if it meant anything anymore



	chapter three

	so what are we going to do

	sunday lunch at jans was over on the kitchen table were the bones of a small roast chicken potatoes in cold fat some broccoli in a bowl half a chocolate pudding from the supermarket and a plastic pot of cream there was also an empty bottle of cheap red wine and two glasses

	coffee

	that would be nice kate played with her wine glass then drank the last few drops

	im afraid i can only offer instant coffee i dont do proper coffee any more its just too expensive

	oh kate paused she was obviously disappointed never mind instant will be fine she lied

	the april afternoon light shone weakly into the kitchen from the small backyard jan put on the kettle for coffee and switched on the light

	we need some light on the subject she said as she banged two mugs on to the table and spooned in coffee from ajar

	kate had arrived at one oclock - just in time for lunch when there was no risk of having to help prepare it she parked her new red bmw outside jans house there were empty beer cans on the pavement the front gardens along the street were full of bags of rubbish lying among the weeds and long grass the new car looked out of place among the old fords fiats and skodas parked in the dirty grey street

	jan poured hot water into the mugs and passed one over to kate

	sugar she asked

	no thanks i must be careful about my figure said kate

	of course i know you have to keep up appearances in your position said jan without smiling

	true said kate with a meaningful look at jans old sweater and dirty jeans i cant afford to let myself go

	so what are we going to do about mother asked jan her voice sounded nervous

	what do you suggest replied kate trying to control her nervousness too the sisters were like wild animals getting ready to attack each other

	well lets face facts mother cant look after herself any more the doctor says so too its all happened so fast she cant remember things she forgets to turn off the cooker she leaves the lights on all the time her fridge is full of rotten food she wets the bed she cant walk properly

	kate interrupted her but is it really that bad i mean there are lots of old people who manage well enough on their own surely if you just carry on coming round a couple of times a week to check up on her

	why me jan was beginning to lose control of her feelings why always me you seem to think i have nothing better to do than look after mother

	its not that

	well what is it then im still trying to get a proper job you know and when i do i certainly wont have time to check up on mother all the time and anyway thats not a solution i told you shes getting worse all the time she cant be left alone what if she falls down in the bathroom or falls out of bed no-one would know weve got to find a proper solution its no good burying your head in the sand like an ostrich its time to stop pretending kate this is serious you may have been dads little favourite but shes our mother not just my mother dont forget that

	as if youd let me forget said kate in a sharp voice anyway what do you suggest you obviously have an idea

	jan took a deep breath then in a calm voice she said i think there are three possibilities number one we find a permanent nurse - someone who can move in with mother and take care of her all the time number two we find a good old peoples home or care centre - i think thats what people call them these days the only problem is that both these solutions cost money lots of money and money is something i dont have even if we sold mums house to raise the cash it would take time and we dont have time

	but i do have money is that what you mean said kate

	well yes you do when dad died he left you half the money from the business mum got the other half i dont mind that but all i got was enough to buy this miserable little house that was typical of the way dad always treated me anyway and you cant pretend you dont earn plenty from your law business

	so i can afford it is that it said kate

	yes i think you can

	my dear jan i dont think you understand anything about money said kate with a cold smile its true that we earn a lot of money but we have to spend a lot too - the childrens education for a start you have no idea how much it cost to send caroline to oxford university and we had to buy her a flat to live in afterwards too and jeremy still has to finish another year at university in cambridge and then hell need money to help him get started too and then theres the cost of running the house and the garden and all the entertainment expenses

	of course but i wouldnt know anything about any of that would i my cindy was a dropout from school so she didnt even get to university and as for your kids when did they last visit their grandmother and you seem to forget how much it cost mother and father to send you to oxford i didnt even get the chance to go to university dad couldnt wait for me to start work as soon as i left school and as you can see my lifestyle is not quite on the same level as yours she pointed at the remains of the meal on the table - the small chicken and the cheap wine

	all im saying jan is that you mustnt think weve got piles of cash to spend on mother our money is tied up in property and investments not under the bed

	oh no but you dont seem to have any problems when you want to go on a luxury holiday abroad or buy a new car or designer clothes do you said jan sharply she was beginning to lose her calm

	look jan how we use our money is our business not yours i realise that something has to be done about mother but dont just think that im going to sign a blank cheque

	so what now asked jan angrily are you still hoping ill checkup on mother for the rest of her life

	wait a minute didnt you say there were three possible solutions whats the third one

	there was a long uncomfortable pause then jan took a deep breath and said what she had on her mind

	the third solution well kate you have a very big house your kids have moved out so you have plenty of room how about fixing up part of the house as a small separate flat for mother your maid could keep an eye on her make sure she had regular meals kept herself clean and all that she wouldnt be in your way

	are you completely mad how could we possibly manage with having mother all the time and what do you think hugh will say when i tell him about your crazy idea its his house too you know

	i doubt if hugh would even notice he seems to spend most of his time away on business trips or playing golf anyway surely you could explain things to him after all he is your husband isnt he arent you supposed to share things - including your problems

	are you suggesting that we dont kate said angrily

	not really im just asking you to think carefully about my idea dont simply say no now i dont think it would be that much of a problem for you at least you wouldnt have to pay for a nurse or an expensive care centre and mother would be in her own rooms so she wouldnt get in the way of your lifestyle you wouldnt have to include her in your dinner parties or anything like that

	kate looked at her watch it was half past three

	look jan its getting late i really have to be home by five thirty i told you - were going out for dinner tonight but we dont seem to have come to a proper decision do we

	we certainly do not replied jan bitterly you say you have no money to pay for mother and i certainly have none i have no proper job and i have cindy to look after too she still has no job and nowhere to live except with me and youve just refused to even consider the idea of having mother living with you we mustnt upset hugh

	thats not quite what i said said kate ill tell you what ill speak to hugh when i can and see what he says but i really dont think hell agree

	ok speak to him but meanwhile what am i supposed to do ive got job interviews in the next couple of weeks i cant look after mother the way i have been doing we need a temporary solution until we finally decide what to do couldnt you at least have mother for a week it would be a kind of trial youd have a chance to see what it would be like come on its not much to ask after all youve got your filipina maid corazon corrie or whatever her name is i need a break i cant go on like this any longer

	kate looked at her watch again ok ill call you tomorrow by then ill have spoken to hugh maybe we can take mother for a week or so till you get your job interviews sorted out will that help but if you do get a job there will still be the problem of what to do in the long term

	it will help thanks said jan she felt such relief at finding a solution even a temporary one

	ok then ill speak to you tomorrow evening thanks for a lovely lunch jan it was nice to see you again

	take care safe journey

	jan watched the red bmw drive off and closed the front door she went back to the kitchen and started to pile the dirty dishes in the sink as she did so tears began to run down her face she cried with relief she cried at the unfairness of life she cried about the way her father had treated her so unfairly all his life for no good reason she cried for the miserable life she had in her small dirty house she cried for cindy and her useless life above all she cried for the strange crazy woman her mother had become



	chapter four

	just this once

	the dinner party was a great success kate had made the reservation at a quiet restaurant by the river thames it was one of those restaurants which almost smelled of money the lights were low with candles and bowls of spring flowers on the tables there were plain white tablecloths with real silver knives and forks crystal wine glasses and large expensive white plates the walls were decorated with old pictures of the river and glass cases containing stuffed fish in one corner a wood fire was burning the waiters wore black bow ties with spotless white shirts and black suits no-one spoke loudly

	apart from kate and hugh there were only four guests: costas clerides and his wife melpa with dark flashing eyes and a low-cut silk dress and hari mazumdar and his wife shantha looking wonderful in a red sari and gold jewellery clerides was greek and owned oil tankers and container ships mazumdar had made his money out of call centers in india both men were seriously rich

	the food and wine were not only expensive but delicious and perfectly matched soon everyone was relaxed and chatting comfortably towards the end of the meal the men moved to one end of the table and were soon deep in discussion about hughs new investment fund the women sat together and talked about fashion books films and holidays kate thought she noticed melpa looking towards hugh quite a lot but maybe it was just her imagination

	they left the restaurant quite late so it was midnight by the time kate and hugh got home he immediately headed to the drinks cupboard and poured himself a large glass of his favourite malt whisky

	havent you had enough to drink darling asked kate

	im celebrating my success said hugh they both want to come in with me if this investment fund works out ill be so rich ill never have to work again

	well done darling said kate though her voice didnt sound as though she meant it but you should be careful ive noticed you seem to be drinking more these days its not good for your health you know

	dont worry about me i know when ive had enough darling said hugh and took a large sip from his glass

	do you know them well asked kate i mean have you met them with their wives before

	weve had lunch in london a few times but they only brought their wives tonight why do you ask

	oh i dont know i thought they were both very attractive didnt you especially melpa

	there was a pause before hugh answered then he said i suppose so it was the men i was concentrating on

	anyway well done darling said kate again there was another pause

	she was wondering if this was the right moment to talk about jans idea when hugh asked her how did you get on at your sisters today i hope it wasnt too boring

	she decided that this was the right time to mention it

	not boring but a bit awkward

	what do you mean asked hugh sipping his drink

	well jan thinks we should do more to help with mother

	what sort of help i hope she doesnt think were going to pay for everything

	we did talk about that and i told her we couldnt but she really does need some help we talked about having mother here for a few days just as a temporary thing-

	what have you gone mad how could we possibly have your mother here

	it would only be for a few days she could sleep in carolines old room and corrie could make sure shes ok

	but you never know what she might do you told me yourself that she forgets where she is and does crazy things she might set fire to the house or leave the taps running in the bath who knows what she might do

	darling in a weeks time youre going away on a business trip she could come then and ill make sure corrie keeps a close watch on her

	hugh finished the last few drops of his whisky and put down the glass

	all right then let her stay while im in the states but for goodness sake make sure she doesnt do anything crazy and kate this is just for a week right and just this once no ideas about her living with us

	of course darling its just this once ill call jan tomorrow and ill talk to corrie now are you coming to bed its monday tomorrow

	no no you go up darling i need to think about how im going to move this investment fund ahead now ive caught the two biggest fish goodnight darling

	kate bent down to give hugh a quick kiss and went upstairs as she looked back she saw hugh pouring himself another large glass of whisky



	chapter five

	back to where we started

	the following sunday afternoon kate picked up her mother from lewisham and drove her to marlow everything started well sarah fell asleep in the car and only woke up when they arrived at kates house kate put her mother in her daughter carolines old room it was a big bright room and overlooked the large garden which went down to the river kate had prepared an early supper for her mother so that she would be back in her room before hugh returned from the golf club when kate looked into her mothers bedroom later she was already fast asleep

	hugh came back late from golf he seemed to be in a strange mood and kate wondered what had happened but he didnt tell her anything he had a quick supper and went straight to bed he left for the airport on his trip to the states very early the next morning without waking kate

	before leaving for work that morning kate left instructions with her maid corrie corrie was an important part of the household without her kate wouldnt have been able to lead her busy professional life as a lawyer corrie took care of everything she cleaned washed ironed and cooked for kate and hugh and she served at table whenever they had guests for dinner she was tiny with dark skin bright eyes and a lovely smile she never complained whatever kate asked her to do

	kate asked corrie to make sure her mother took a bath when she got up and to make her breakfast and mid-morning coffee she suggested that corrie should call her mother by her first name sarah kate also explained that her mother acted strangely sometimes so corrie would need to be patient with her

	sometimes she forgets things or gets things mixed up in her head dont worry about it too much just try to make her as comfortable as you can i know you will

	and one last thing corrie she said as she left please make sure you give mother her supper before seven before i get back she likes to go to bed early ill go up and say goodnight to her after i get back

	corrie was surprised that sarah was already up and dressed when she went into her room at eight oclock sarah ate a big breakfast then sat reading the newspaper in her room corrie thought she seemed like a perfectly normal old lady

	but when corrie took her some coffee at eleven oclock things started to become a little unusual

	hello dear are you the waitress said sarah can you call the manager id like to talk to him

	corrie didnt know what to say so she began to put the coffee things on the small table next to sarahs chair

	im speaking to you young lady said sarah sharply youd better answer me i want to see the manager im not satisfied with the service here

	corrie was totally confused by this situation she tried to deal with it as best she could

	im sorry sarah we no got manager only got mr hugh and he go to america

	how dare you call me sarah since when does a waitress call a customer by her first name so impolite go and get me the manager immediately she screamed

	by now come was getting really worried she decided to play the part of a waitress in a hotel to satisfy sarah

	very well madam she said ill go downstairs and look for manager now i come back soon-soon

	thats better said sarah

	back in the kitchen corrie wondered what to do should she phone kate but she knew kate had an important meeting in london she decided to wait a few minutes and then go back to see how sarah was

	when corrie went back to sarahs room the old lady was asleep with the newspaper open on her lap the cup was on the floor and the coffee was all over the carpet corrie got a cloth and began to clean up the mess

	sarah suddenly woke up looked at her and said hello dear how nice of you to call in to see me would you like some coffee oh dear it looks as if someone has dropped it on the floor never mind i can get you some more

	is all right madam i not need coffee

	why are you calling me madam asked sarah with a puzzled expression i thought we were friends why dont you call me sarah

	yes sarah said corrie now completely confused by sarahs unusual changes of behaviour i look for manager but so sorry he go for meeting

	manager what manager said sarah but i wonder if youve seen my father someone told me he lives round here but i havent seen him for a long time have you seen him

	your father so sorry i dont know him said corrie

	yes you do said sarah hes tall and handsome he works for a tailor in the west end of london he makes clothes for all the famous people you must know him

	so sorry said corrie but i not see him

	never mind i expect hell come round to see me one of these days said sarah

	after a pause the expression on her face changed she looked nervously around the room

	this is a nice room isnt it dear where am i do i live here are they coming to ask me any questions i dont know the answers

	she seemed very upset and worried so corrie tried to hold her hand and put an arm round her shoulder to comfort her sarah suddenly became angry

	you take your hands off me who do think you are what are you doing in my house she shouted

	then quite suddenly she burst into tears rocking her body backwards and forwards in her armchair and mumbling confused phrases

	i dont want to say anything that will get me into trouble she moaned you dont know what its like theyre watching me all the time theyve got all these questions and i dont know the answers

	this time she allowed corrie to comfort her corrie helped sarah out of the chair and on to the bed

	you just have a little rest now sarah she said i come and call you for your lunch ok

	sarah eventually calmed down and soon she was asleep corrie tiptoed quietly out of the room

	sarah slept through lunchtime and only woke at five oclock she seemed to be quite normal again and ate a big piece of fish with peas and potatoes and drank several cups of strong tea she was warm and friendly towards corrie she chatted with her about life in the philippines and about corries family corrie told her how well her children were doing in school and she explained how hard it was for her when she thought of them growing up without their mother so far away when kate came back at seven they were still chatting

	how was your day mother kate asked

	oh ive had a lovely time this is my new friend i cant remember her name but shes from abroad somewhere have you met her before

	of course ive met her mother she works here

	oh does she said sarah absent-mindedly then she fell silent obviously deep in her own private thoughts

	soon after this corrie took sarah back upstairs

	goodnight mother ill come up later after youve had your bath said kate

	corrie stayed with sarah for a while then when kate came up to say goodnight to her mother she went down to prepare kates supper

	later in the evening kate joined corrie in the kitchen

	so how was today how did you get on with mother

	corrie felt embarrassed she didnt know how to answer finally she said oh i think she very nice but sometime she forget about something i try to help her but sometime she a little bit difficult to understand

	oh im sure youll manage said kate just let me know how things go tomorrow all right

	i do my best said corrie

	i know you will i dont know what id do without you corrie i really dont goodnight

	goodnight madam said corrie suddenly she felt very tired and more than a little worried about the next day



	chapter six

	never again

	the next day started uneventfully it was only after lunch when corrie and sarah were sitting in the kitchen that things started to go wrong again

	sarah sat staring completely lost in her own thoughts again her eyes empty then suddenly she began to sing

	all things bright and beautiful

	all creatures great and small

	all things wise and wonderful

	the lord god made them all

	her voice was high and very shaky on the top notes and she sang the words of the old sunday school hymn very deliberately rolling the rs and pronouncing all the final consonants it was a strange almost crazy performance

	sarah suddenly looked straight at corrie and ordered her to sing too: come on now all together and she began to sing again all things bright and beautiful come on dear all together join in come on

	corrie who had never heard the words or the tune of this hymn before didnt know what to do

	come on dear its a lovely hymn we used to sing it at sunday school come on

	and she sang the first verse again conducting wildly with her arms spread wide like some crazy old bird flapping its wings she moved on to the second verse

	come on you can do better than that she told corrie

	each little flower that opens

	each little bird that sings

	he made their glowing colours

	he made their tiny wings

	corrie tried her best to sing along but sarah was clearly not satisfied with her efforts

	back to the chorus she said and waved her arms even more wildly all things bright and beautiful-

	and that wasnt the end of it sarah went on and on repeating the verses over and over again corrie began to wonder if she would ever stop singing

	the week went on and somehow corrie got used to the old woman and her crazy talk at times sarah would act quite normally but other times she would refuse to eat her food or throw it on the floor one morning she woke up and refused to get out of bed often she would ask corrie about her father and mother as if they were still alive sometimes she seemed not to recognise kate or she thought that corrie was her daughter luckily corrie was a patient and kind person so somehow they got through the week

	on wednesday evening after supper kate asked corrie again how do you think mother is now

	madam i think she very old and maybe she got problem with her memory but she a nice lady i think maybe she need her family with her

	yes well it would be nice i know but we havent got the time to be with her all day - were so busy anyway shell be going home soon

	in fact kate had hardly spoken to her mother she left for work each morning before sarah was up and only got back in time to say goodnight to her

	kate was about to go up to bed when she remembered something hugh had called her from new york and wanted her to prepare a special dinner party on friday evening again for his business friends but this time he wanted it to be at home so it would be more informal and private

	oh corrie we have six people coming to dinner on friday well talk about the food tomorrow but can you manage to feed mother early and make sure shes back in her room before the guests arrive

	yes madam i will do my best said corrie though she wondered how she would manage to look after the old lady and cook the dinner too

	

	hugh got back on thursday evening he slept late on friday morning then went off to play golf kate was glad he wouldnt be around in case he met her mother hed obviously forgotten all about her and corrie felt grateful that she wouldnt have to cook him lunch it was always difficult to please him and he usually found something he didnt like about her cooking though everyone else always praised her skill as a cook she didnt like hugh she thought he wasnt a nice man at all

	after she had taken sarah her breakfast corrie went down to the kitchen to start preparing the evening meal for the guests at lunchtime she took up a light meal to sarahs room but sarah wasnt there kate was working at home in her study so corrie went to tell her and together they started to look for sarah they looked all over the house but didnt find her after half an hour they were both feeling very worried then by chance corrie looked out of the window in sarahs room and saw her at the bottom of the garden right next to the river they ran out of the house and down to the river - just in time to see sarah standing in the river with the water up to her knees

	hello she said isnt it a lovely day shall we all go for a swim

	somehow they managed to get sarah out of the river and back to her room corrie gave her a hot bath and put her back to bed

	wasnt that lovely dear said sarah and immediately fell asleep

	but in the afternoon she woke up and started her crazy singing again kate had gone out so it was corrie who had to go up to her room with some tea and biscuits to try to calm her down sarah went on singing the same hymn she had sung earlier but much much louder this time

	corrie was starting to feel worried because she still hadnt finished preparing for kates dinner party eventually over half an hour later sarah stopped singing and without saying a word went back to bed and fell asleep again corrie sighed with relief and began to lay the table in the big dining room

	

	corrie served sarah a light supper on a tray in her room then left her to make the final dinner preparations

	where are you going dear

	i have to prepare some things for kate corrie replied

	oh i can help you dear said sarah

	no no no need thank you said corrie terrified at what might happen if sarah came downstairs

	oh all right then i think i shall have another bath

	the guests began arriving at seven thirty hugh served drinks in the lounge then everyone went through into the dining room this was an important business dinner for hugh he was hoping to get someone else to sign up for his new investment fund this time the clerides and the mazumdars were joined by an english couple - the manninghams clive manningham had been at oxford university with hugh so they knew each other well all the ladies were dressed in expensive clothes again and melpa clerides was looking especially wonderful like a film star kate thought a little jealously - melpa seemed so much more elegant than she did

	getting all these important people together in the same place at the same time hadnt been easy to arrange so hugh really wanted everything to go well then just as the guests were sitting down the dining room door flew open and sarah stood in the doorway she was wearing bright red lipstick lots of eye make-up and her nightdress

	im so sorry to keep you waiting she said in her best voice im truly very happy to see you all here please do make yourselves at home just like old times now shall we have a little sing-song

	and she started to sing all things bright and beautiful in a very loud voice conducting wildly and encouraging the guests to join in

	hugh of course was furious get her out of here he said to kate in an angry voice

	after some confusion in which a couple of wine glasses were broken and some dishes knocked on to the floor they managed to lead her out of the room and back upstairs but hughs dinner party was ruined at least for him the guests didnt seem to mind; they just found it amusing everything soon returned to normal and everyone enjoyed the excellent dinner that corrie had prepared but for hugh it felt like the end of the world

	just get her out of this house and never bring her back do you understand never hugh shouted as soon as their guests had gone kate followed him through to the lounge he suddenly turned on her his face still red with anger

	i want her out of here by tomorrow that mad old woman has ruined my business deal and made us both look like idiots in front of those people how can i ever invite them again

	i know it was bad darling but it wasnt that bad in fact i think they all thought it was quite funny their wives too im sure it wont ruin your business deal these are grown-up people - surely they wont hold it against you

	im not so sure that crazy old woman made us look like idiots if i look like an idiot maybe theyll think i am an idiot you dont know how these peoples minds work

	anyway im sorry it happened said kate and of course mother cant stay here it was a bad idea i should have known it wouldnt work something i didnt tell you was that she walked into the river this afternoon she could have drowned if she can do that goodness knows what else she might do it wouldnt be safe to have her here ill call jan in the morning and tell her ill be taking mother back to lewisham tomorrow she wont like it but its too bad we have our own lives to lead

	thats the least you can do after whats happened replied hugh

	now ill have to start trying to pick up the pieces ill have to call everyone tomorrow and try to calm things down lets hope my partners dont walk away from the investment fund now that weve got so far with it

	im sure it will all pass no-one will even remember it in a month from now people easily forget these things

	i hope youre right now i think of it maybe it would have been better if your mother had kept walking into the river that would have been one less problem for us to think about

	hugh how can you say such a thing she may be a nuisance but no-one wants her dead

	are you so sure said hugh roughly im pretty sure your sister jan wouldnt mind losing her

	lets leave jan out of this shall we ill have enough to do explaining to her why we cant keep mother here

	all right but sometimes i think it would be better to get rid of people like your mother theyre no use to anyone and it costs the country millions of dollars to keep them alive

	ok hugh thats enough im tired i want to go to bed - its been a busy week kate walked to the door then paused oh by the way where did you go today when i was putting your things away i noticed your golf shoes were clean - there was no dirt on them at all i thought you were supposed to be playing golf

	there was an uncomfortable silence

	well no actually said hugh i wanted to play but on the way to the club i got a call from macey he wanted me to meet him in the office something urgent

	i thought you were taking the day off since youd just got back from the states are you sure

	of course im sure what are you suggesting macey was right to call me too we could have lost a lot of money i spent most of the day with him trying to sort it out i cant afford any problems with this new fund all ready to start up

	kate had a strange feeling perhaps hugh was telling her the truth but perhaps he wasnt his story didnt sound quite right where could he have been if he wasnt playing golf and wasnt at work but she felt too tired to argue

	anyway goodnight darling she said as she kissed him lightly on the cheek and went towards the stairs as she went up the stairs she heard the usual pop of a cork from a bottle and the sound of whisky being poured things werent right between her and hugh he seemed more and more like a stranger to her things couldnt go on like this

	they must have a proper talk soon she decided

	

	the following morning kate called jan

	im sorry jan it wont work im driving mother back home this morning maybe you could be there when she arrives im sorry dont say anything i know all the arguments but she cant stay here she just cant thats final

	jan swore under her breath and put the phone down they were back to square one back to where they had started



	chapter seven

	difficult choices

	when kate took her mother home on saturday morning jan wasnt there instead it was cindy who opened the door

	cindy was twenty-eight her hair was bright green and she wore rings lots of rings: rings in her ears a nose ring and a lip ring and a ring through her tongue too her face was unnaturally pale like dough for making bread she looked as if shed just climbed out of bed she didnt speak to kate who for once didnt know quite what to do or say

	eventually kate said please tell your mother ill call her later

	clear off said cindy and shut the door in her face

	who was that nice lady taxi driver asked sarah

	cindy burst out laughing in spite of her bad mood

	never seen her before she replied

	she was very well-spoken said sarah perhaps her husband lost his job so she has to drive a taxi now

	could be said cindy smiling to herself it was such a lovely idea

	can i have my tea now asked sarah

	ok ill make us both a cup

	cindy took sarah into the kitchen and put on the kettle sarah sat looking out of the window with empty eyes

	where are we she asked suddenly have i been here before

	this is your home gran said cindy

	dont you remember

	are you sure i dont think ive been here before do i have to do anything special

	no gran just wait a minute and well have a cup of tea then you can have a rest i have to go out for a little while but ill be back later and make you your lunch

	do i have to do anything special today

	no gran i told you just sit there till the teas ready

	sarah sat nervously squeezing her hands with a frightened look in her eyes

	do i have to do anything special today she asked again

	cindys good mood began to disappear

	i told you no gran for gods sake stop asking me the same question all the time youre driving me bananas

	wheres my tea asked sarah

	cindy dropped two teabags into the pot and poured in boiling water

	nearly ready she said

	as they sat drinking the mugs of tea sarah began to show signs of nervousness again

	do i have to introduce you to anyone here she asked

	cindy replied heavily no gran

	when am i going home sarah suddenly asked

	youre at home now said cindy

	am i i dont recognise it have i been here before

	youve lived here for the past forty years gran said cindy dont you remember

	its a nice cup of tea said sarah do i have to do anything special today

	cindy took a deep breath and stopped herself from saying anything she was beginning to feel desperate to escape from this crazy old woman

	somehow cindy got through the rest of the day jan had gone to london so cindy couldnt just leave her grandmother alone (though she really wanted to) but she did manage to go back-home a couple of times which made the day just about bearable luckily it was only a few minutes walk away so she never left sarah alone for long

	when jan arrived at six cindy was cooking sarah an omelet

	hello mother said jan to sarah

	hello dear how was your holiday replied sarah

	oh dear said jan to cindy how did it go

	come into the other room and ill tell you said cindy

	they left sarah to eat her omelet and went into the lounge

	before you say anything cindy let me tell you my news i got the job i got a letter this morning they offered me the post of assistant to the sales director as a start but they told me there are plenty of opportunities for promotion the moneys not bad either and i can start next monday isnt that great news

	yes mum im really happy for you youll be working again at least well have some regular money coming in again apart from my weekly benefit payments and your odd jobs

	but tell me how you got on with your grandmother said jan she sounded worried

	well mum it was a whole new experience i hadnt realised just how strange she was i mean i havent had much contact with her recently not since i came back from the drug rehabilitation centre but shes totally mad most of the time if you ask me she almost drove me mad too asking the same questions over and over and half the time she doesnt know where she is or who anyone is but i have to say shes really funny too sometimes she thought kate was a taxi driver thought her husband had lost his job

	if only he had maybe kate might act a bit more like a human being said jan

	yeah she said shed call you by the way kate i mean i told her to clear off shes a real cow

	cindy and jan stayed with sarah till bedtime then walked back to their own place in the dirty side-street littered with empty beer cans and old plastic bags

	

	the following morning jan went round to see her mother when she opened the door she found smoke pouring out of the kitchen there was a terrible smell of burning sarah was sitting calmly in the lounge reading the newspaper

	jan rushed into the kitchen turned off the gas grabbed a saucepan from the cooker and took it out into the garden it was completely black and had started to melt

	mum what have you been doing why did you leave the saucepan on the cooker again couldnt you smell the burning

	burning oh i thought it was from next door has my milk boiled yet

	has it boiled you nearly set the house on fire thank goodness i came when i did

	if the milk has boiled can i have my coffee then said sarah completely unaware of the danger she had been in

	jan spent the rest of the morning cleaning up the mess and getting rid of the strong smell left by the burnt saucepan then she made some lunch for her mother and went home

	when she returned to her mothers at seven that evening her heart sank the house was in total darkness she opened the front door and called out to her mother but there was no answer she called again this time there was a faint sound from upstairs like a dog crying she ran up and found sarah lying on the floor of the bathroom her arm was bent at an awkward angle and there was blood on her face she was moaning with pain

	oh mum what have you done this time

	when the doctor came he told jan that her mother had broken her wrist he bandaged it tightly and told her to take sarah to hospital the next morning

	theres nothing to worry about he said but she mustnt be left on her own can you stay with her

	well ill have to i suppose at least till tomorrow

	how old is your mother now

	shes seventy-nine said jan shes been a bit of a problem since my father died four years ago she seems to be losing her memory and she gets very confused at times she doesnt seem to know where she is or who people are sometimes she thinks im her mother it worries me sick its got a lot worse in the last couple of weeks

	have you thought about getting her into a care centre i really dont think she should be living alone its dangerous for her or is there anyone who could move in with her

	jan sighed your colleague told me she needed twenty- four-hour care too when i spoke to him a few weeks ago its something were discussing with my sister at the moment she said trying to smile

	good said the doctor and in the meantime ill arrange for her to have some tests for alzheimers sadly its more and more common the more old people there are the more cases of alzheimers we must expect we still dont know how to treat it properly but at least you should know how badly her memory has been affected the surgery will get in touch with you to fix an appointment

	thank you doctor said jan not even trying to smile this time

	

	the following evening jan and cindy were sitting downstairs in sarahs house sarah was fast asleep upstairs her arm was now covered in thick white plaster

	cindy theres something ive got to ask you

	whats that mum

	i want you to help me out ive never asked you before and ive always been there when you needed me - when you had the drugs problem when you had the abortion to get rid of the baby when that steve man threw you out ive never blamed you and ive never asked you for anything in return i suppose i always blamed myself for not being a better mother but now i need you cindy someones got to take care of your grandmother she cant be left on her own any more the doctor says so and i say so and anyway its obvious ok ok i know what youre going to say: why cant kate help out for a change why me but sometimes we have to do things its not fair but thats how it is i mean its ages since i went out for a meal or went to see a good film - and you know how i love the cinema ever since i broke up with your father all those years ago ive been doing part-time rubbish jobs temporary work as a secretary supermarket check-out jobs nothing permanent now for once i have a chance at last

	i got my diploma in marketing it wasnt easy but i got it and now ive got a good job i wont be able to work and look after your grandmother as well its just not possible so please cindy

	mum im sorry but i just cant its not that i dont want to help you but look at yesterday after a while she just started to get on my nerves i mean i felt like killing her she goes on and on asking the same questions saying the same silly things and you know what will happen if i do break down ill run back to the drugs again i just cant do it mum i cant spend all my time with a crazy old woman like her i cant i dont mind helping out now and again but i cant be with her full time and youre right why should that selfish sister of yours walk away from it all god i hate her and that husband of hers too why cant we get gran into a care centre

	two reasons cindy we cant afford it and secondly i dont want my mother to be stuck with a lot of people just like her or worse sitting in a lounge with the tv on all day with nothing to do except drink weak tea those places are terrible i want her to have some dignity left at the end of her life - not to be treated like an animal

	jan didnt argue any more she was exhausted she went upstairs to sleep in her old room at her mothers house but an idea was beginning to grow in her mind a solution to her problem a terrible desperate solution she fell asleep thinking about it



	chapter eight

	hopeless

	it was sunday again and raining a miserable wet british sunday the sky grey above the roofs of the sad grey houses

	jan hadnt slept well all night long she had been arguing with herself about what she planned to do she tried to be logical and to look at the facts clearly without emotion fact one: her mother was now unable to look after herself her condition was getting worse fast fact two: neither kate her sister nor cindy her daughter was willing to look after her fact three: she herself now had the chance of a proper job with a good salary if she stayed at home to look after her mother that chance would be lost and she would probably never get another chance fact four: if her mother took too much of her medicine by accident she wouldnt suffer and the problem would be solved

	but however logical her arguments were there was a voice in her head that kept whispering the word murderer she had tossed and turned in her bed all through the night but she had found no way out of her problem every way she turned she met a solid wall she felt trapped

	shes your mother how could you do it the voice said

	but why should i be the one to suffer she asked herself after all shes so far gone now that she doesnt get any pleasure out of life most of the time she doesnt even know where she is its as if shes sitting in the dark prison of forgetting she cant make sense of her life whats the point surely id be saving her from her misery

	then the other voice would attack her again how could you possibly even think of killing your mother once its done you wont be able to undo it you know youll be sorry for it for the rest of your life

	but i cant make her well again either no-one can undo her condition whats the point of making her suffer like this

	 the arguments went round and round in her head until she felt physically sick she felt like a wasp trapped in a jam jar finally in the late afternoon she decided her mother was upstairs having her afternoon sleep jan made a cup of tea she put the bottle of pills on the tray with the tea things then she took it up to her mother

	sarah swallowed her usual two pills without noticing them with her cup of tea jan had decided to give her two more pills a few minutes later then two more then two more sarah was so forgetful that she wouldnt remember taking the first pills no-one would suspect jan when the police came they would find the empty pill bottle it would look like an accident

	jan opened the bottle and took out two more pills

	here you are mum time for your pills she said nervously and in her head she asked to be forgiven for what she was about to do but before she could give the pills to sarah the phone began to ring downstairs she waited but the phone went on ringing and ringing with the pills still in her hand she ran downstairs to answer it

	hello mum its cindy

	oh cindy erm i erm er what is it said jan

	mum are you ok your voice sounds all shaky and strange is anything wrong hows gran

	shes erm fine im just giving her tea why are you calling anyway

	listen mum ive been thinking about what you said i know how much this job means to you so ive decided to try and help you out after call ill look after gran for you at least for a time till we can find something better but i hope you can help me too sometimes i cant face being with her twenty-four hours a day seven days a week

	cindy youve saved my life said jan (and your grandmothers too she thought) of course ill help you whenever i can oh my god i think im going to cry look ill call you back later ok i just need to do something

	she ran back upstairs sarah was still sipping her tea jan put the pills back in the bottle put the top back on tightly and put it safely in her pocket

	more tea mum she asked

	yes please dear was that your father on the phone

	no mum it was cindy shell be coming to look after you tomorrow

	oh will she is she that small lady with the dark skin i liked her even if she is a foreigner she had a lovely smile

	no mum but you like cindy too

	oh do i i dont think i know her

	yes you do but dont worry about it

	what about my pills asked sarah have i taken my pills

	yes mum said jan with relief youve already taken them



	chapter nine

	hughs little problems

	in the weeks following the dinner party kate hardly saw her husband he always left very early in the morning and usually came back very late and sometimes he spent the night away - in paris frankfurt milan or athens he said he was working hard to make sure his investment fund was a success he told kate he had meetings the whole time - about how to attract money to the fund and how to invest it to make big profits for the partners and even when he was with kate he seemed uneasy he avoided her and didnt seem to want to talk about anything important

	she was getting more and more worried about what was happening between them was something seriously wrong with their marriage they had known each other since they met as students at oxford that was twenty-five years ago after all that time and with two grown-up children they knew each other very well or she had thought they did now she wondered how well she really knew this man she had spent so much of her life with

	of course he wasnt perfect in fact he had some rather serious little problems he drank too much just like his father who had died from drink he seemed to be able to drink large quantities of any kind of alcohol - beer wine whisky gin vodka - and he rarely seemed to be affected by what he drank but kate knew that one day something serious would happen either he would do something stupid or he would get ill

	another of his little problems was that he was by nature a gambler he didnt play cards for money or bet on horses or go to the casino and play roulette but he was a gambler he played with money - other peoples money of course that meant he was always taking chances hoping for a big win but it was dangerous kate knew this all too well because a few years back he had lost a lot of money and almost gone to prison for it luckily some of his friends had helped him out but this hadnt stopped his gambling habit it was an addiction he couldnt help it; it was stronger than him his new investment fund was also a gamble and kate wondered how big the risk was this time

	and like many handsome men with a lot of money hugh had a weakness for beautiful women and they were attracted to him too kate remembered how he had looked when they met: so strong and handsome with long dark hair and a smile like a film star and she remembered the brief affair he had had with that actress after jeremy was born but kate wondered if he was still quite so attractive now in his late forties losing his hair getting fat around the middle and without his smile too most of the time was it possible that he still attracted women as he had done when he was younger kate herself certainly didnt find him attractive in that way any longer

	then one evening when she came home with all these thoughts in her mind kate heard a mobile phone ringing it was coming from hughs study he was away in paris and hed obviously forgotten his mobile by the time she picked up the phone the ringing had stopped before switching off the phone she noticed there were ten missed calls all from the same number and the callers name was melpa



	chapter ten

	pictures from the past

	hello gran how are you feeling this morning

	cindy put a mug of tea down on her grandmothers bedside table

	heres your tea youd better drink it while its still hot

	im not feeling too good today

	oh whys that then

	im thinking too much

	what are you thinking about gran

	my feet

	your feet

	yes my feet they make me think and i keep forgetting things but my bloods better now so they say

	who says gran

	oh you know that nice young doctor

	cindy gave up trying to guess who her grandmother was talking about maybe this doctor was someone left over from a dream

	well thats good anyway the blood i mean said cindy as she smoothed the bed sheets

	but theres a lot of things i want to do but i cant

	there was a pause

	i dont know where the pots and pans are thats the trouble

	i expect theyre in the kitchen where they belong said cindy

	what kitchen asked her grandmother i dont remember any kitchen where is it

	its downstairs of course said cindy

	whose house is this anyway i dont think ive been here before

	its your house gran its where youve lived for the past forty years

	oh is it she asked and drank her tea

	cindy suddenly started to giggle uncontrollably

	oh gran sometimes youre really funny you know

	well at least i make you laugh its better than crying i can tell you that

	then all at once she put her mug of tea back on the table and knocked it over sarah was obviously in pain

	gran are you ok

	no

	is there any pain

	no its just the didgery she moved uncomfortably on the pillows

	but cindy couldnt stop giggling again at the didgery shed never heard the word before and it sounded so funny in spite of the situation her gran was in the didgery her gran had just added a new and original word to the english language

	here gran let me lift you up a bit youll be more comfortable

	ow dont you hurt me who are you anyway wheres that nice taxi lady

	its ok gran just rest for a minute ill get your pills for you just lie back and relax

	sarah lay back obviously more comfortable as cindy left the room she went back to sleep when cindy returned with the pills she was already fast asleep snoring loudly with her mouth wide open her hands moving nervously on the sheets as if she was trying to find something then quite suddenly she sat up opened her eyes and asked is this where we all get off

	get off what thought cindy does she think shes on a bus or does she mean this is where she gets off the journey office

	she felt a wave of sadness and sympathy for the human ruin her grandmother had become she began to cry quietly at first then sobbing uncontrollably sarah didnt seem to notice her tears

	come on then im not going to sit here all day lets get on with it

	cindy dried her eyes she helped her grandmother into the bathroom helped her wash and dress then she supported the old lady downstairs to the kitchen

	cindy thought and this is only the beginning of the day what will the rest be like

	she sat sarah at the table and made her some breakfast

	dont ask me what theyre saying about me said sarah i dont know and they keep on asking me all those questions and i cant answer i dont know the answers her voice sounded frightened again

	never mind gran just have some breakfast ok look some nice croissants with your favourite jam

	

	after she moved in to stay with sarah cindy gradually got used to her new routine: helping her grandmother to wash and dress changing the sheets when she wet the bed getting her meals sitting with her when she wasnt asleep putting her to bed at night

	and she also somehow got used to the strange illogical conversations she had with the old lady sarah would suddenly say things that seemed to come from nowhere and she seemed to believe that they were watching her and asking her questions which she couldnt answer

	occasionally she would say something that was connected to a childhood memory at other times things she said seemed unconnected to anything it was tiring for cindy to try to make sense of what sarah said yet sometimes she could be so funny that cindy just couldnt help laughing

	people say that children often get along better with their grandparents than with their parents cindy had certainly had a stormy and sometimes unhappy relationship with her own mother now she began to feel herself growing fond of this strange old woman who was her grandmother

	one afternoon as she was tidying one of the cupboards cindy found an old photograph album she looked through the pages most of them were family pictures faded and yellow with age their corners turning up at the edges like autumn leaves cindy could recognise some of her relatives: her grandfather and grandmother when they were young; her mother jan as a child and as a teenager; her aunt kate too

	but there were even older photos almost brown now and very faint they were like ghosts these men and women in victorian clothes standing stiffly for formal photographs children in old-fashioned school uniforms - all of them staring at the camera like people from another world the past is another country cindy remembered reading somewhere how true it was

	what are you doing in these came sarahs voice

	im just looking at some of your old photos gran thats all

	here bring them over here i want to have a look

	cindy took the album and sat next to sarah on the sofa

	look gran she said

	sarah began to turn the pages slowly then she stopped and pointed at one of the photos

	my mum and dad she said in the photograph was a young couple the young woman was wearing clothes fashionable in the 1920s the man was also fashionably dressed he had a sad sad smile

	sarah said again my mum and dad have you seen them anywhere

	cindy didnt answer the question instead she pointed to another photo this one showed a very young couple standing either side of a table with a pot plant on it the man was wearing a soldiers uniform the woman looked young enough to be a schoolgirl

	thats my mum and dad repeated sarah again this time she sounded really excited 1914 first world war they were engaged to be married my dad went to the war he went to the great war

	she found another photo this was a wedding photo it had the date underneath it: 20 december 1918 again sarah pointed and once more said excitedly my mum and dad its their wedding but i wasnt there

	i should hope not said cindy with a smile

	my dad was lucky he came back but he had something wrong with him they called it shell shock he couldnt work properly after that my poor dad

	cindy pointed at another photo: a woman with a baby

	thats my mum and my little brother tom said sarah

	you had a brother asked cindy i didnt know that

	he died when he was one said sarah died of flu

	when were you born gran asked cindy is this you she pointed to another baby picture

	thats me thats me said sarah born in 1924 20th of may 1924 thats my birthday mustnt forget my birthday name: sarah morton address: 11 spring grove lewisham south london always remember your address my mum said in case you get lost and then you can tell the policeman

	cindy realised that somehow the old photos had opened a window into sarahs memory she had spoken sensibly for once cindy now felt sure that something of her grandmother remained somewhere inside that old weak body there was still a real person but only just and only sometimes

	by the time jan arrived a few minutes later the window into sarahs memory had already closed

	sarah looked at jan and said to cindy whos that

	its your daughter jan said cindy

	whats she come here for said sarah

	shes come to see you gran

	well shed better have a good look then hadnt she said sarah loudly

	both jan and cindy exploded in laughter



	chapter eleven

	a win-win situation

	kate had been intending to have a serious talk to hugh about the missed calls on his mobile phone when he came back from paris that weekend but somehow it never seemed to be the right time or maybe she was avoiding it by delaying for as long as possible something told her it was a very dangerous subject kate now knew for sure that he hadnt been playing golf that friday after he came back from the states she had called the club secretary and he had told her hugh hadnt been there that day she added this to the list of things she needed to face him with when they finally had their talk together but this evening hugh wanted to discuss something else he seemed quite excited about an idea he had had

	ive been thinking about your mother again he said

	how do you mean asked kate whatever made you think of her

	well ive had an idea that might just work out everyone would get what they want out of it a win-win situation

	everyone who is everyone get what whats this all about

	well the situation is that your mother needs special care your sister jan cant afford it your mother cant afford it and we dont want to pay for it ourselves right

	right said kate wondering where this was leading

	so what we do is this we offer to pay $1500 a month to jan to arrange a nurse for the old lady

	but i thought you said we wouldnt pay

	wait a minute theres more we dont do it for nothing we pay her the money monthly but when the old lady dies which is probably not long the house would belong to us wed draw up an agreement which jan would sign to agree that the house would become our property its quite a common kind of arrangement these days when people are living longer and cant look after themselves anymore

	so its like a gamble on how long mother will live

	in a way yes if she lives till shes ninety thats about ten years we would have paid $180000 but the house is worth at least $250000 i think and if they redevelop the area for new houses the land alone would be worth even more than that so we would make at least $70000 if she lives to be ninety but im sure she wont live that long just think if she only lived for another year wed make over $150000 its a fantastic opportunity for us and it solves jans problem too everyone wins its a win-win situation

	my god are you serious said kate but she could see from the look on hughs face that he really was

	of course im serious

	but when mother dies we might get the house anyway i cant see the point of spending money now

	your mother is a crazy old woman who knows who shell leave the house to this is one way to make sure of it and lets face it shes not likely to live for much longer so we wont have spent much anyway

	when he had started talking about her mothers death in terms of the money they might get from it kate had felt at first that it was wrong how could they use the situation to make more money for themselves but then she started to think it wasnt such a bad idea after all without their money jan would be stuck with mother till she died maybe it looked bad to make money like this but as hugh said in a way it was a win-win situation for once it would be a bet they were sure to win and it was a way to make sure their mothers house came to them she had no idea what was in her mothers will it was in an envelope at the solicitors office and would only be opened after she died suppose her mother had left the house to jan or cindy or the battersea dogs home anything was possible but if they could get jan to agree to this arrangement it would be theirs anyway

	let me think about it she said maybe ill call jan tomorrow and arrange to go and see her - if shes still speaking to me that is



	chapter twelve

	planning an outing

	a week had gone by and it was sunday again jan was sitting with cindy in sarahs kitchen after lunch sarah was asleep upstairs

	how are you getting on then asked jan

	well i think its the most tiring thing ive ever done you know what grans like one minute she knows who you are the next minute she doesnt recognise you and she swings between saying all those crazy things with no connection to anything and moments when she says something totally sensible of course there are still times when i feel like killing her but im getting to like her a lot actually and sometimes she says things that make me fall about laughing shes so funny i told you about the didgery didnt i well every so often she comes out with something like that last night i was trying to help her into bed all of a sudden she says hey none of that frooky-pooky here i mean what can you do all you can do is laugh

	it sounds as if youre managing anyway i cant tell you how grateful i am cindy if you hadnt helped me out i couldnt have taken the job

	how are you getting on there asked cindy whats it like now that youve settled in a bit

	oh its great everyones very friendly and the works really interesting and my boss is nice and very good- looking too i think he likes me - well you know fancies me i must say i wouldnt mind that either

	oh come on mum

	just joking well anyway hes started to pass on really interesting jobs to me now he seems to trust me to meet clients and all that no its really good-

	im so glad mum i really am

	there was a pause then jan got up to put the kettle on for coffee

	im sorry ive been so busy with my new job that i havent had time to help out with your grandmother ill stay with her tonight though if you want a break and i can be with her the whole of next weekend if you like its her birthday on sunday

	thats ok mum said cindy

	i dont mind i dont feel like going out tonight anyway but it might be nice to get out next weekend thanks but if its her birthday i might stay around anyway

	jan made coffee real coffee this time thinking of the coffee reminded her of kate she sighed

	of course we cant go on like this for ever i havent spoken to kate since she brought your grandmother back and dumped her on us again i cant bear the idea of phoning her she makes me feel sick shes so selfish but some time or other were going to have to face it again after all you cant be expected to spend the rest of your life looking after your old grandmother

	more like the rest of her life said cindy i dont think shell live longer than me do you

	you know what i mean said jan

	yes i do and anyway its time i got myself a proper job too

	jan said nothing yet she could hardly believe her ears cindy was talking about a proper job shed been a dropout since school shed never had a proper job at all shed wasted the last ten years shed been on drugs slept rough on the streets in london been involved with some criminal characters had an abortion when one of them made her pregnant everything you could think of but it seemed as if she might be changing jan hardly dared to hope it was so

	cindy went on i think it may be because of gran in a way i mean she makes me think look at her the poor old thing is all burnt out even if she does show the occasional spark of life i dont want to end up like her or if i do i want to make something of my life first

	well if youre going to get a proper job youll need to get some qualifications first have you got any idea what you want to do

	i could always be a barmaid i suppose just joking mum just joking no im not sure but maybe something to do with looking after people im not keen on nursing though not after looking after gran maybe something like physiotherapy or maybe chiropody or whatever they call it these days - you know looking after peoples feet and all that i dont really know though what do you think

	jan thought for a moment ill ask around if you like i can check it out on the internet at work maybe its a pity we dont have a computer at home i think id better get one as soon as theres some money in the bank maybe you could ask around too theres a chiropodists in the high street maybe they could advise you about training

	thanks mum yes lets find out but i cant really do anything till we sort out what to do about gran

	i know we keep circling around the problem and we always come back to the same place if only my dear sister kate had a tiny bit of kindness in her we could easily sort it out

	just then as if it had been listening to their conversation the telephone rang

	ill get it said cindy hello there was a pause oh its you we were just talking about you another pause ok here she is cindy passed the phone to jan its kate she wants to talk to you

	jan took the phone yes what do you want

	kates voice on the other end sounded uncertain jan please i was worried about you and about mother how is she is she all right

	how dare you ask me that you dumped her on the doorstep like a sack of potatoes and went back to your palace on the thames for gods sake dont pretend you care about us or about her youve got rid of her thats all you care about

	jan please listen im really sorry about what happened

	whats the point of being sorry it doesnt help us it doesnt help mother either honestly youre such a liar if youre really so worried about her why dont you do something to help

	jan thats why im calling you

	what do you mean

	i mean im calling you because ive been thinking about the situation im really sorry for what i did but it was an impossible situation please try to understand anyway i think we may be able to help out with mother

	oh really and how do you suggest youll do that asked jan bitterly

	its a bit complicated jan i think i need to see you so that we can talk it through together can i come down to see you next weekend

	i suppose so ill be here with mother cindys going off for a break shes been looking after mother non-stop since you dumped her here i hope you realise wed be in a real mess without cindy its just as well we didnt have to depend on your kids to help

	so shall we say sunday

	all right then come to mothers for lunch in case youve forgotten its her birthday shell be eighty

	of course said kate who obviously had forgotten her mothers birthday thanks for reminding me is there anything she needs what can i bring her

	use your imagination said jan so ill see you on sunday then about eleven

	yes ill come as early as i can goodbye then

	goodbye

	what do you make of that then said jan to cindy

	i dont know what did she say

	she said she thinks she and hugh might be able to help out with mother

	how

	she didnt say said it was too complicated so shes coming down to see me on sunday you wont be here so no need to worry

	selfish woman why cant she just say straight out what they want to do whats so complicated about it

	i dont know i just hope its real this time

	me too said cindy but ive just had a brilliant idea for grans birthday present ill take her to the seaside for the day itll be fun for both of us and i can always take some time off later

	no way said jan she can hardly walk and she hasnt been out of the house for ages-

	all the more reason for taking her out then isnt it said cindy i can borrow a wheelchair and im sure my friend sue will lend me her car just for a day ill take gran down to brighton i know she used to like going there before when grandad was still alive itll do her the world of good and then you wont have to worry about having her around when kate comes come on mum it will really do her good

	i dont know are you sure you can manage with her all by yourself

	of course i can no problem at all ok so thats settled then

	but what about kate if you take your grandmother out she wont be able to see her when she comes on sunday

	serves her right said cindy its about time that selfish woman was given some of her own medicine she doesnt care about us so why should we care about her

	and so it was agreed that cindy would drive sarah to brighton for the day on her eightieth birthday



	chapter thirteen

	i do like to be beside the seaside

	cindy made all the arrangements she managed to borrow a wheelchair from a friend of a friend whose father had recently died and her friend sue was happy to lend cindy her car for the day

	on the saturday night cindy went clubbing with a group of her old friends but she came home early somehow it didnt seem as much fun as before in fact the crowds loud music and silly shouted conversations made her feel a bit ill

	

	happy birthday gran she said as she took sarah her cup of tea the next morning

	what what are you talking about said sarah

	today is your birthday gran said cindy youre eighty years old today

	am i who told you that
